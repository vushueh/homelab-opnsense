## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- This is a **lab environment** configuration
- Some settings prioritize ease of use over security
- **Review and harden** before production use
- Management interface has NO internet access (by design)
- Attack lab (VLAN 250) is isolated for security testing

### Prerequisites
To implement this configuration, you need:
- Basic networking knowledge (IP addressing, routing, VLANs)
- Access to hypervisor host (Hyper-V or Proxmox)
- Managed switch with VLAN support
- OPNsense installation media
- Familiarity with CLI (PowerShell, Bash, Cisco IOS)

### Hardware Requirements (Minimum)
- **Hypervisor Host**: 16GB RAM, 4+ CPU cores, 100GB storage
- **Managed Switch**: VLAN-capable (802.1Q tagging)
- **Network Cards**: Multiple NICs for interface separation
